### Hi! I'm Esteban Geraldo👋🙋‍♂️

## About me :mortar_board:
From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology. This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge is enough knowledge**. 🧠

## What I know 💻
```js
const Esteban = {
    technologies: {
        FrontEnd: HTML, Javascript, CSS: ["Bootstrap"],
        BackEnd: Java: ["SpringBoot"], Python: ["Django"],
        Databases: MySql, Postgresql.
    }
};
```
## Next steps:
- Learn Python
